Manually – or automatically when you save your Javascript files.\n\n![Screencast](https://github.com/renke/atom-import-sort/blob/master/media/atom-import-sort.gif?raw=true)\n\nThis package does **not** sort `require` calls. Only ES6-style imports are supported as of now. Support for `require` may be added later, but it's generally harder to do this compared to imports.\n\n# Installation\n\n`apm install atom-import-sort`\n\n# Usage\n\nUse  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> or the `Import Sort: Sort` command to sort imports on demand. Make sure you are actually editing a file that uses the `js` grammar (I highly recommend [language-babel](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel)).\n\nImports can also be sorted automatically on save when `Save on sort` is enabled in the package's settings. This is disabled by default because it's annoying at times.\n\n# Sorting\n\nThe resulting order of imports is currently hardcoded into the package (although it's actually configurable in [import-sort](https://github.com/renke/import-sort)) and looks like:\n\n```javascript\nimport \"aaa\";\nimport \"bbb\";\n\nimport \"./aaa\";\nimport \"./bbb\";\n\nimport _ from \"xyz\";\nimport a from \"a\"\nimport A from \"A\";\nimport B, {b} from \"B\";\nimport {C} from \"C\"\n\nimport __ from \"./xyz\"\nimport aa from \"./a\"\nimport AA from \"./A\";\nimport BB, {bb} from \"./B\";\nimport {CC} from \"./C\"\n```\n\nEventually I want to support different layouts that can be chosen in the setting's page or on a per-project basis. Suggestions for other layouts are always welcome.\n\n## License ##\n\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/renke/atom-import-sort/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/renke/atom-import-sort#readme","_id":"atom-import-sort@0.6.0","_shasum":"6848ee1778a6d344cd3dcf4975472c61b1c6e2fc","_resolved":"file:../d-116431-9276-h30r1w/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116431-9276-h30r1w/package.tgz"}
