## Installation

First you have to install the `tool-bar` package which is required:

```bash
apm install tool-bar
```

Then you install the `tool-bar-almighty` package:

```bash
apm install tool-bar-almighty
```

## Options

1. You have the ability to include [custom entries](https://github.com/varemenos/atom-toolbar-almighty#custom-entries).
2. You also have the ability to load the [suggested defaults](https://github.com/varemenos/atom-toolbar-almighty#toolbar-entries) along side your custom entries, or only the custom entries.

## Custom entries

You have the ability to include custom entries in the tool-bar-almighty by enabling the option in the package settings and entering a path relative to your `.atom` directory (that contains the entries you want to add).

The file must be in JSON format that contains an Array of entries.

### Format

The format is based on [tool-bar's](https://github.com/suda/tool-bar#example) but include 2 extra properties.

1. `type` indicates whether the entry is a `button` or a `spacer`
2. `dependency` indicates whether a button's package is not installed by default in Atom and should only be displayed if it's package is installed.

### Example

* Create a file inside `.atom`'s directory, in this case `~/.atom/custom_entries.json`
* The tool-bar-almighty setting's value must match the filename mentioned above `custom_entries.json` (relative to the `.atom` directory)
* The content of the file should look like the following:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "button",
    "tooltip": "Open File",
    "callback": "application:open-file",
    "icon": "document-text",
    "iconset": "ion"
  },
  {
    "type": "spacer"
  },
  {
    "type": "button",
    "tooltip": "Open Folder",
    "callback": "application:open-folder",
    "icon": "folder",
    "iconset": "ion"
  },
  {
    "type": "button",
    "tooltip": "Merge Conflicts",
    "dependency": "merge-conflicts",
    "callback": "merge-conflicts:detect",
    "icon": "code-fork",
    "iconset": "fa"
  }
]
```

## Known Issues / FAQ

* We've decided to remove the term2/term3 entries from the default entries, for more details and a possible fix read [this](https://github.com/varemenos/atom-toolbar-almighty/issues/9) issue's thread.
* We've decided to only support the JSON format for the custom entries to prevent future formating issues.
