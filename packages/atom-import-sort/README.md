# atom-import-sort

Sort ES2015 (aka ES6) imports directly from within Atom. Both JavaScript and TypeScript are supported.

After you installed the package you can sort your imports using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> key binding or trigger it manually from the command palette with the `Import Sort: Sort` command.

The package also offers a "sort on save" option to automatically sort your imports whenever you save a JavaScript or TypeScript file. It's disabled by default.

See [`import-sort`](https://github.com/renke/import-sort) for information about customizing the way imports are sorted.
